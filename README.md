# GuitarGame_ChartFormats

A repository of documentation for chart files of guitar- or band-centric rhythm games such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

## Work In Progress

This documentation project is a work in progress. Some documents may need to be split or restructured/duplicated for variations in other games.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and add your own changes or documentation for other games.

Some general recommendations:

- Start with the basics, then elaborate further as you go down.
- Try to keep things organized on a track-by-track basis. If event types are shared between tracks, document them in a higher section that indicates that.
- Make uncertainty in your documentation clear. If you don't understand something fully, note it down as such.
- If you used external references, link them as sources in a References section so others can reference those as well.

These are not strict guidelines, but they help to make referencing and adding to easier.
