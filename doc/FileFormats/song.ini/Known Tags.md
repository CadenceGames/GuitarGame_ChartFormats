# Known song.ini Tags

There are *many* tags in existence, so listing them all in one place is rather difficult. Still, this should be a pretty extensive list of them.

In the descriptions, game names in parentheses indicate where the tag originates from if it is either specific to a game, is more specialized, or is a legacy tag. FoFiX stands for Frets on Fire X, PS stands for Phase Shift, and CH stands for Clone Hero.
