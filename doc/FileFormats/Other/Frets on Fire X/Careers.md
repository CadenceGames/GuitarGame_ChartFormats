# FoFiX Careers

FoFiX supports careers for song packs.

## Structure

Careers are structured by placing all the songs that are part of a career setlist within a folder, and using both a titles.ini file and specific song.ini tags to define various parts of the career.

### song.ini Tags

| Tag Name           | Description                                                              | Data type     |
| :-------           | :----------                                                              | :-------:     |
| `unlock_id`        | Name of the career tier that this song belongs to.                       | string        |
| `unlock_require`   | Name of the career song/tier that must be completed to unlock this song. | string        |
| `unlock_text`      | Text to display if the song is locked.                                   | string        |
| `unlock_completed` | Indicates whether or not the song is unlocked. (*not* a boolean value)   | number        |

- `unlock_id` - Name of the career tier that this song belongs to. A general structure of this tag consists of the following:
  - `<career name>_<tier name>.<song number><enc (optional)>`
    - `career name` is the name that should be used for the career, e.x. `gh3`.
    - `tier name` is the name/number that should be used for the tier.
    - `song number` is used for ordering songs within a tier.
    - `enc` is an optional part of the tag that indicates if this song is an encore.
- `unlock_require` - Name of the career song/tier that must be completed to unlock this song.
- `unlock_text` - Text to display if the song is locked.
- `unlock_completed` - Indicates whether or not the song is unlocked. Generated by the game.
  - Value is determined by removing the song order prefix from the song name using a regular expression of `^[0-9]+\. *`, then multiplying the length of the song name by the length of the artist name, then adding 1.

Example:

```
unlock_id = tier_01c
unlock_require = tier_01b
unlock_text = Complete tier 1B to unlock this song!
```

### titles.ini

`[titles]` section:

| Tag Name   | Description                                                                                          | Data type |
| :-------   | :----------                                                                                          | :-------: |
| `sections` | Lists the .ini section names for tiers specified within the titles.ini file, separated with a space. | string    |

Tier sections:

- Tier section titles are listed in the `titles` section's `sections` value. Every name listed there should be checked for the following tags:

| Tag Name    | Description              | Data type |
| :-------    | :----------              | :-------: |
| `name`      | Name of this tier.       | string    |
| `unlock_id` | Unlock ID for this tier. | string    |

Example:

```
[titles]
sections = tier01 tier02 tier03

[tier01]
name = Tier 1
unlock_id = tier_01

[tier02]
name = Tier 2
unlock_id = tier_02

[tier03]
name = Tier 3
unlock_id = tier_03
```
