# song.ini

song.ini files are used for storing song metadata. Originally they were used for .mid, but Clone Hero also extends this to .chart files.

## Basic Structure

### Sections

Sections are a header line containing only a string encapsulated in square brackets:

`[SectionName]`

Section names are not necessarily case-sensitive.

A song.ini file should contain a `[song]`/`[Song]` section header.

### Tags

Tags are a key-value pair that store each metadata entry, stored in this general format:

`<Key> = <Value>`

- `Key` is the name of the value.
- `Value` is the stored value. The data type depends on the key. Some tags may contain multiple values.

The equals sign may, but is not required to be, padded by spaces, but it is recommended to pad it as not all games/programs support song.ini files without the padding (namely Phase Shift).

Tags can be listed in any order, and may have inconsistent capitalization to the tag names listed below.

Value type info:

- `number` fields are whole numbers typically written in base 10.
  - A value of -1 may be used in some number fields to indicate that there is no value set.
- `float` fields allow decimal places and are also written in base 10.
- `string` fields typically, but don't always, use quotes. Strings that don't use quotes will be marked as such.
- `boolean` fields can be either `True`/`False` (or `true`/`false`), or `0`/`1` (only a couple booelan tags do this, but simplest to specify it for all).
- `file name` fields

Specialized value types:

- `Pro Guitar tuning` - 4 to 6 numbers representing semitone differences from standard tuning, and an optional string for the tuning name
  - Examples:
  - `0 0 0 0 0 0 "Standard tuning"`
  - `0 2 5 7 10 10`
  - `-2 0 0 0 "Drop D tuning"`
  - `0 0 0 0 0`
- `MIDI note`/`MIDI velocity` - Any MIDI note/velocity number. Notes go from 0 to 127, velocities go from 1 to 127.

### Comments

Comments are not fully standardized, but may appear in some files.

Comments are typically delimited using either a semicolon `;` or a hash `#`. Some .ini file implementations only support one or the other. Additionally, some implementations only support comments that are a line of their own, while others may allow trailing comments.

## Known Tags

There are *many* tags in existence, so listing them all in one place is rather difficult. Still, this should be a pretty extensive list of them.

Note that for string tags, there may be [formatting tags](http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/rich-text/) present, such as `<color=#00FF00>`. Make sure to trim these out after parsing if you don't want to use them.

In the descriptions, game names in parentheses indicate where the tag originates from if it is either specific to a game, is more specialized, or is a legacy tag. FoFiX stands for Frets on Fire X, PS stands for Phase Shift, and CH stands for Clone Hero.
